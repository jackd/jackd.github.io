> "So far we have not seen a rise in hospitalisations... Even with those rising numbers itâ€™s mainly cases not hospitalisations at the moment." - Professor Kelly.

- [12.4% base hospitalisation rate](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/in-focus/hospitalisations.pdf)
- [First case detected on November 28](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Pages/weekly-reports.aspx?fbclid=IwAR2bFT1O0LrTYX6t2WvbvWxyK6USz98cKqR9ayozLpEwZ0R8ZbhmM8zoVyk)
- [Omicron potentially causes 29% less hospitalisations](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03794-8)
- [Omicron hospital stays of more than 1 day reduced by 40%](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/232882/some-reduction-hospitalisation-omicron-delta-englandearly/), though disentangling this from protection thanks to prior infection is difficult
- There is no reduced hospital capacity due to staff shortages
- [Mean length of stay: 8.0 days](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-021-06371-6) - note this is the mean for patients not admitted to ICU. ICU mean stay 16.2 days (12.4 in ICU)
- [Boosted protection from severe disease: 95.7%](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/omicron-a-significant-challenge-to-two-dose-vaccin). Also suggests 2-dose MRNA provides 78.8% protection from hospitalisation.

## Australia's vaccination status

From the ABC's [Charting the Jab](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-02/charting-australias-covid-vaccine-rollout/13197518)

- Australia is currently at 76% double-vaccinated, 79% single - assume this gets to 80% double vaccinated
- 90.8% 16+ - potentially could get to 94%
- As of August 15 (5 months prior to Jan 15) 21% of people were double-vaccinated
- 26% 16+
