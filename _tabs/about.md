I recently completed my PhD at QUT in Brisbane, Australia, looking at deep learning approaches to 3D inference and feature extraction methods under the principle supervision of [Dr Frederic Maire](https://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/f.maire). During my PhD I enjoyed minor lecturing roles in the maths and physics departments.

Following submission I completed a 6 month internship with Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK, with the [All Data AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/podcast/all-data-ai-with-dr-andrew-fitzgibbon/) team looking at reinforcement learning approaches to compiler optimization.

I have recently commenced a post-doc at University of Melbourne looking at attention-based graph networks for cyber security applications under [Prof. Chris Leckie](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6335-christopher-leckie).
